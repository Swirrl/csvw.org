      The CSV format has proven enormously popular in the open data world.
      Historically, faced by so much data being published in PDFs, the CSV
      format was a byword for machine-readability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s enduring popularity is no doubt helped by the fact that csv files are
      near universally accessible. Practically everyone has access to a
      spreadsheet program - like Microsoft Excel - to read and write csv files.
      Unlike excel’s prioprietary xls format, the humble csv is also easy to use
      programmatically - you don’t even really need to use a library.
    </p>
    <p>CSV does have some problems, however.</p>
    <p>
      Although the IETF published a standard -
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">RFC4180</a> - for CSV in
      2005, there are still a wide range of interpretations to be found in the
      wild. These different dialects of csv take different approaches to quoting
      fields and escaping special characters. That’s not to mention
      <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">differences in encoding that plague any text format</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also not possible to say in advance how the fields in CSV file ought
      to be interpreted - i.e. their data type. You have to read a few lines of
      a file and take a guess from these initial rows - i.e. “I’ve not seen any
      letters in this column, only numbers, and no decimal points so it’s
      probably an integer variable”. There are clever tools for doing this
      guesswork for you, but whenever you're ingesting a csv file you will
      likely need to devote a few lines to interpreting the data. Typically
      this will be to parse dates or give the columns syntactically-valid
      variable names.

      Despite these problems, CSV has become the lingua franca of open data, and
      not without good reason. It’s an incredibly simple way to reach the third
      star of the <a href="http://5stardata.info/">5 star deployment scheme</a>
      for open data:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>★ you can publish csv on the web (with an open license)</li>
      <li>★★ csv is a machine-readable table</li>
      <li>★★★ csv is non-proprietary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But what about the final 2 stars? On it’s own, CSV doesn’t really help you to
      acheive those:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        ★★★★ using identifiers to denote things, so that people can talk about your
        resources unambigiously
      </li>
      <li>★★★★★ linking your data to other data to provide context</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are the distinguishing characteristics of linked-open-data. These
      features enable data from different sources to be connected and queried,
      forming a web of data. This network is most strikingly depicted in the
      <a href="https://www.lod-cloud.net/">linked-open-data cloud</a>.
    </p>
    <p><img src="guides/lod-cloud.png" /></p>
    <p>
      Publishers wishing to contribute to this cloud, or leverage the informative
      context it can provide for their own data, have to shift their perspective
      from a tabular view of the world with it’s rows, columns and cells to one of
      graphs, nodes and edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have also had to abandon CSV along the way and instead learn a new set of
      technologies like RDF ontologies and SPARQL queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s against this backdrop that a W3C working group set out to provide
      recommendations for working with CSV on the Web. This “CSVW” standard provides
      a way to resolve the problems with CSV (standardising dialects and expressing
      types) <em>and</em> to extend it with identifiers to make 5 star linked-data
      in CSV format. In practical terms, this means associating your CSV file with a
      JSON document that provides some addition metadata to describe and clarify the
      content of the CSV table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/metadata-standards-for-sharing-and-publishing-data">
        UK Government has recently adopted the CSVW standard</a>
      and recommend that government organisations “Use the CSV on the Web (CSVW)
      standard to add metadata to describe the contents and structure of
      comma-separated values (CSV) data files”.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re delighted to see the power of linked-data being brought to the venerable
      CSV format and hope that this will ensure it’s continued popularity for many
      years to come.
